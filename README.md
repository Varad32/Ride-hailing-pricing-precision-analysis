# Ride-hailing-pricing-precision-analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and improving the upfront pricing model used in ride-hailing services like Uber and Ola. Upfront pricing estimates the ride cost based on predicted distance and time, providing transparency to customers before they book a ride.

However, if the actual metered price differs significantly (more than 20%) from the predicted upfront price, it can lead to unexpected fare changes for customers. Our goal is to minimize these discrepancies, enhance price prediction accuracy, and ensure a smooth and predictable customer experience.

Key Objectives:
Analyze the gap between upfront and metered prices.
Optimize prediction models using historical data.
Enhance pricing precision to reduce unexpected fare adjustments.
This project aims to build a reliable and transparent pricing strategy that maintains customer trust and satisfaction by minimizing deviations between estimated and actual ride costs.
